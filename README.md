# Hello, I'm Henry ðŸ‘‹

I am a college student at public university, and I will be a new graduate in early December. 

As a college student and soon to be new graduate, I'm interested in game development, web development, virtual reality, and augmented reality. I enjoy working on exciting new problems, learning new tools, and picking up new skills.
